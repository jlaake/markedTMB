\title{Defines model specific parameters (internal use)}
\usage{
setup.model(model, nocc, mixtures = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{name of model type (must be in vector \code{valid.models})}

\item{nocc}{length of capture history string}

\item{mixtures}{number of mixtures}
}
\value{
model.list - a list with following elements \item{etype}{encounter
type string for MARK input; typically same as model} \item{nocc}{number of
capture occasions} \item{num}{number of time intervals relative to number of
occasions (0 or -1)} \item{mixtures}{number of mixtures if any}
\item{derived}{logical; TRUE if model produces derived estimates}
}
\description{
Compares \code{model}, the name of the type of model (eg "CJS") to the list
of acceptable models to determine if it is supported and then creates some
global fields specific to that type of model that are used to modify the
operation of the code.
}
\details{
In general, the structure of the different types of models (e.g.,
"CJS","Recovery",...etc) are very similar with some minor exceptions.  This
function is not intended to be called directly by the user but it is
documented to enable other models to be added.  This function is called by
other functions to validate and setup model specific parameters.  For
example, for live/dead models, the length of the capture history is twice
the number of capture occasions and the number of time intervals equals the
number of capture occasions because the final interval is included with dead
recoveries.  Whereas, for recapture models, the length of the capture
history is the number of capture occasions and the number of time intervals
is 1 less than the number of occasions.  This function validates that the
model is valid and sets up some parameters specific to the model that are
used in the code.
