\title{Merge time (occasion) and/or group specific covariates into design data}
\usage{
merge_design.covariates(ddl, df, bygroup = FALSE, bytime = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ddl}{current design dataframe for a specific parameter and not the
entire design data list (ddl)}

\item{df}{dataframe with time(occasion) and/or group-specific data}

\item{bygroup}{logical; if TRUE, then a field named \code{group} should be
in \code{df} and the values can then be group specific.}

\item{bytime}{logical; if TRUE, then a field named \code{time} should be in
\code{df} and the values can then be time specific.}
}
\value{
Design dataframe (for a particular parameter) with new fields added.
See \code{\link{make.design.data}} for a description of the design data list
structure. The return value is only one element in the list rather than the
entire list as with the older function \code{merge.occasion.data}.
}
\description{
Adds new design data fields from a dataframe into a design data list
(\code{ddl}) by matching via time and/or group field in the design data.
}
\details{
Design data can be added to the parameter specific design dataframes with R
commands.  This function simplifies the process by enabling the merging of a
dataframe with a time and/or group field and one or more time and/or group
specific covariates into the design data list for a specific model
parameter. This is a replacement for the older function
\code{merge.occasion.data}. Unlike the older function, it uses the R
function \code{\link{merge}} but before merging it makes sure all of the
fields exist and that you are not merging data that already exists in the
design data.  It also maintains the row names in the case where design data
have been deleted prior to merging the design covariate data.

If \code{bytime=TRUE},the dataframe \code{df} must have a field named
\code{time} that matches 1-1 for each value of \code{time} in the design
data list (\code{ddl}).  All fields in \code{df} (other than time/group) are
added to the design data.  If you set \code{bygroup=TRUE} and have a field
named \code{group} in \code{df} and its values match the group fields in the
design data then group-specific values can be assigned for each time if
\code{bytime=TRUE}. If \code{bygroup=TRUE} and \code{bytime=FALSE} then it
matches by group and not by time.
