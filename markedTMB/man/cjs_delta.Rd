\title{HMM Initial state distribution functions}
\usage{
cjs_delta(pars, m, F, T, start)
}
\arguments{
\item{pars}{list of real parameter matrices (id by occasion) for each type of parameter}

\item{m}{number of states}

\item{F}{initial occasion vector}

\item{T}{number of occasions}

\item{start}{matrix with values that are first occasion and for some CJS type models the state of first observation}
}
\value{
2-d array of initial state probability vectors for each id
}
\description{
Functions that compute the initial probability distribution for the states. 
Currently only CJS, MS models and MS models with state uncertainty are included and
these all use cjs_delta to assign a known state.
