\title{Accumulates common capture history values}
\usage{
cjs.accumulate(x, model_data, nocc, freq, chunk_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data}

\item{model_data}{list of design matrices, fixed parameters and time intervals all which can vary by animal}

\item{nocc}{number of capture occasions}

\item{freq}{frequency of each capture history before accumulation}

\item{chunk_size}{size that determines number of pieces of data/design matrix that are handled. Smaller chunk_size requires more
time but less memory. 1e7 is default set in cjs.}
}
\value{
modified model_data list that is accumulated
}
\description{
To speed up compuation, animals with the same capture history and design matrix are
accumulated and represented by a frequency. Computes starting values for Phi and p parameters from the
list of design matrices and the summarized data list including ch matrix and
first and last vectors. If any values are missing (NA) or abs(par)>5, they are
set to 0.
