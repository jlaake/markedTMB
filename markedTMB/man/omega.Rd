\title{Compute 1 to k-step transition proportions}
\usage{
omega(x, k = NULL, labels = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{either a transition matrix, list of transition matrices or 3-d array ( a set of transition matrices)}

\item{k}{if x is a transition matrix, this is number of steps 1 to k}

\item{labels}{labels for states except for last which is always dead and is added at end}
}
\description{
Computes 1 to k-step forward transition proportions in each state with a single transition matrix or a 3-d array of transition matrices.
